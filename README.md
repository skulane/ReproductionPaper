For the Deep Learning reproduction project, we have written a blog about our reproduction of the paper '[Adapting Neural Networks for the Estimation of Treatment effects' by Shi et al](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.02120.pdf)'. This blog can be found [here](https://skulane.github.io/ReproductionPaper/).
